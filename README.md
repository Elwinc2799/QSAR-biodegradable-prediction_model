# QSAR-biodegradable-prediction_model
In this project, a QSAR biodegradable data set is given which contains values for 41 features that can be used to classify 1055 rows of data into 2 classes which is the Ready-Biodegradable (RB) and Non-Ready Biodegradable (NRB). All the attributes in the data set are molecular descriptions that have relationships between chemical structures and biodegradation molecules. A machine learning model and fuzzy logic model is built to predict the target variable, which is the experimental_class.
